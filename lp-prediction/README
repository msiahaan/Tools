LP Prediction
Version: 0.1
GPL

This is my first application using cherrypy + kid.
I made this app to help me predict amount of LiquidPower required, in ppm, to be injected into a pipeline.

I am a fans of MVC principle: as programmer we separate between model, view and controller.

1. Model: equations.py, contains all equations needed to calculate required LP
2. View: kid act as a view, how the web app will be shown
3. COntroller: cherrypy as controller, acting to control information flow inside the application.
